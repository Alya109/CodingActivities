    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a crucial aspect of writing robust and reliable Python code. Exceptions are events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, Python generates an error message that can be caught and handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n",

    "- `SyntaxError`: Invalid syntax\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Operation or function applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value\n",
    "- `NameError`: Local or global name is not found\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Index out of range\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Dictionary key not found\n",
    "- `FileNotFoundError`: File or directory not found\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Division or modulo by zero\n",
    "- `ImportError`: Import statement fails\n",
